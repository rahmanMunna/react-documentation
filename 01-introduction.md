# Introduction to React

## What is React?

React is a **front-end JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It was developed and is maintained by **Meta (formerly Facebook)**.

React allows developers to create large web applications that can update and `render` efficiently `in response` `to changing data` — `without reloading the page.`

One of React’s core features is the ability to **write HTML-like code inside JavaScript files** using a syntax called **JSX (JavaScript XML)**. This enables us to write UI components that contain both structure and logic.

### Key Features:

- **JSX** — Write HTML-like markup directly in JavaScript files.
- **Components** — Build encapsulated, reusable UI blocks.
- **Virtual DOM** — Efficiently updates the real DOM.
- **Declarative** — Describe *what* you want to render, and React handles the how.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow** — Data flows from parent to child components.
- **Strong Ecosystem** — Powerful libraries like React Router, Redux, etc.

## File Extension

React components that use JSX typically have the extension:

```text
.jsx
